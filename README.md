Embedded software development with C++ 

This software is desined for the systems that have following hardware;

1 - Arduino Portenta H7 for Microcontroller
2 - Velodyne Alpha Prime Lidar for distance calculation
3 - The MPU6050 as IMU for sensing the rotaion, direction, speed and location of the machine 
4 - Raspberry Pi Camera Module V2 for Camera
5 - Maxon Motor RE-40 for actuator
6 - Talon SRX 120D for motor controller


Remind that you have to setup Arduino IDE in your project but in this repository the folder that contains the Arduino IDE will be ignored
